                    <h3>The tour</h3>
                    <p>In this landscape we can appreciate the majestic place with an impressive view of the sun that is at sunset, as if that were not enough, you can take pictures of the light that the sun emits and show the beauty of nature. It is good
                        to go with a group of friends to be able to see this sighting, which is approximately from 3pm to 5pm in the afternoon.</p>

                    <p>Near the statue of the fog catcher there is a place where you can camp, during the night you can see the stars in an image never seen before since at that height we can see the night sky more clearly, and it is recommended to be able
                        to do camping between the months of July and September.</p>
